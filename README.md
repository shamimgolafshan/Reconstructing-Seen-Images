# Reconstructing seen images from visually evoked fMRI using a promoted shape-semantic GAN
In this project, we tried to increase the quality of Images that people saw during an experiment. Our base article was: 
## Data
We used preprocessed data from "Reconstructing Perceptive Images from Brain Activity by Shape-Semantic GAN"[1]
